# Using the `fh.wdlR` Package

The Shiny app deployed at Fred Hutch to allow users to submit workflows to running Crowmell servers is built using an R package which is freely available in GitHub.  

https://github.com/FredHutch/fh.wdlR


This R package allows you to use R/RStudio on your local machine (on VPN or on campus) to directly submit workflows to your server from the command line, and lets you track calls and workflow execution status directly.
